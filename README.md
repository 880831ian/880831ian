### Hi My name is Pin-Yi 👋

I am from Taiwan 🇹🇼 

I am learning containerization tools such as [Docker](https://github.com/docker) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes). 💻

There are also CI/CD tools such as [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) and [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins)

I will also write some [PHP](https://github.com/php),  [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel), [Golang](https://github.com/Golang) and [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs). I will put some of my own programs on [GitHub](https://github.com/github). 

I am writing a [blog](https://pin-yi.me) myself. Welcome to discuss and learn together. 😍
