<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Pin-Yi</h1>

<p>I am from Taiwan 🇹🇼</p>

Hello everyone! My name is **Pin-Yi Chuang** (CHUANG, PIN-YI), but you can also call me **Ian**.  
I am currently working as a **System Architect (SA)**, responsible for designing and testing our company’s system architecture, and assisting the technical team in solving system-related issues.

I help the company implement **disaster recovery (GCP > AWS)**, and I am in charge of designing, implementing, and managing permissions for **AWS services** to ensure that our infrastructure is scalable and flexible. I also led the integration of **Datadog** to unify our previously scattered monitoring systems.

In addition, I am experienced with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** services and enjoy managing large-scale cloud resources using **Terraform + Terragrunt** (GCP Modules: 12, AWS Modules: 22). I also work with **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, **EFK**, and other log collection and monitoring tools to ensure service stability and observability. I assist the R&D team in building **CICD deployment pipelines** as well.

In my free time, I like reading technical documentation, writing blogs, and joining offline tech communities. I have attended **Google Next 2025**, **DevOpsDay 2023|2024**, **Cloud Summit 2024|2025**, and **AWS Summit 2025**. Through these events, I hope to learn more and connect with other tech enthusiasts.
