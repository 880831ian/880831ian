### Hi My name is Pin-Yi 👋

I am from Taiwan 🇹🇼 

I'm a junior site reliability engineer and I love building services with Kubernetes. 💻

My favorite tools lately are [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) and Kustomization and [Okteto](https://github.com/okteto/okteto). They really work great XD

I will also record the learning process on the [blog](https://blog.pin-yi.me). Welcome to discuss and learn together. 😍
